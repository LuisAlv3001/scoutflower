                <p>Xflor is founded by a friend crew called Exploradores Flor; we established the friend group and came up with the name back in 2015, when we were all still in high school. The years kept on going by and we remained friends, but on the early months of 2021, something switched on who we wanted to really be. It was then, that on an early morning in Pavas, San José; two original members came up with the idea of blending experiences and storytelling with artwork and creativity in order to create a wearable piece. That’s how Xflor clothing started, from a conversation between friends looking for a way to generate income to support their own personal projects. Now, a simple conversation about a fantasy is starting to become a reality, we are first launching our online store and we hope to reach out to as many people as possible; we want to make our customers a part of our story and share with them the experiences we collect along the way.</p>
