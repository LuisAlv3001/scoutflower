                <p>We are and always have been just a group of friends doing what groups of friends do but in the early months of 2021 two friends of the group had an idea; blending experiences and storytelling with artwork and creativity in order to make a wearable piece. Behind every design there’s a story, Xflor is the way to share our creations through clothing and generate and income for our audiovisual productions.</p>
